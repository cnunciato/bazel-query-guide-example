# Install Bazel. Here, we install Bazelisk with Homebrew, as we're running on
# Buildkite's macOS hosted agents. If you were running on a different operating
# system, you'd adapt this script to install Bazel in whatever way is
# appropriate for that OS. See the Bazel install docs for details.
# https://bazel.build/install
brew install bazelisk

# Also install Graphviz, to generate visualizations.
brew install graphviz
